Developing Data Products Course Project (Shiny Application)
====================

This course project uses data from the mtcars dataset from the R datasets library. It allows the user to interactively compare the relationship between two variables at a time by displaying a scatterplot, best-fit line, and resulting linear model.

## Dataset

#### Motor Trend Car Road Tests

The data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973â€“74 models).

The following 6 continuous variables can be compared:

- Miles/(US) gallon
- Displacement (cu.in.)
- Gross horsepower
- Rear axle ratio
- Weight (lb/1000)
- 1/4 mile time

Users can select which of these variables to plot on the x- and y-axes, after which the 32 automobiles from the dataset will then plotted. The best-fit line and associated linear model that describe the relationship between the two selected variables will then also be displayed.
